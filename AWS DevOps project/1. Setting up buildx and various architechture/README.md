To transfer your Docker build tasks, including setting up buildx and enabling various architectures, to the Jenkins container, you can create Jenkins jobs or pipeline scripts that execute these commands within the Jenkins environment.
Here's a basic example of how you can set up a Jenkins pipeline script to accomplish this:

pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Setup Buildx') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker context create --docker host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock main-context'
                sh 'docker context use main-context'
                sh 'docker buildx create --use main-context --name main-builder --config ~/.docker/buildkitd.toml'
                sh 'docker buildx use main-builder'
                sh 'docker buildx inspect --bootstrap'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Install Dependencies') {
            steps {
                // Enable specific architectures
                sh 'docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install arm64,arm/v6,arm/v7'
                
                // Or enable all architectures
                // sh 'docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all'
                
                // Set buildx as the default builder
                sh 'docker buildx install'
            }
        }
        
        // Add more stages for your actual build tasks...
    }
}




This pipeline script defines two stages: one for setting up buildx and another for installing dependencies. You can add additional stages for your actual build tasks.
To create a Jenkins job with this pipeline script:
1. Open your Jenkins dashboard.
2. Click on "New Item" to create a new job.
3. Enter a name for your job and select "Pipeline" as the job type.
4. Scroll down to the Pipeline section, and in the Definition dropdown, select "Pipeline script".
5. Paste the above pipeline script into the Script section.
6. Click on "Save" to save your job configuration.

Now, whenever you trigger this Jenkins job, it will execute the defined pipeline stages, including setting up buildx and enabling architectures as specified. You can further extend the pipeline to include your actual Docker build tasks.
