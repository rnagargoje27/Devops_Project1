
Certainly! You can create a self-signed TLS certificate for your Docker Registry using the IP address of the machine as the Common Name (CN) parameter. Here's how you can do it using OpenSSL:
1. Generate Self-Signed Certificate: Run the following OpenSSL command to generate a self-signed certificate:
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -keyout domain.key -x509 -days 365 -out domain.crt -subj "/CN=<IP_Address>"

Replace <IP_Address> with the IP address of your machine where the Docker Registry will run.
Prepare Docker Registry Configuration: Create a Docker Registry configuration file (config.yml) with TLS settings:

version: 0.1
log:
  fields:
    service: registry
storage:
  filesystem:
    rootdirectory: /var/lib/registry
http:
  addr: :443
  tls:
    certificate: /etc/docker/registry/domain.crt
    key: /etc/docker/registry/domain.key

Run Docker Registry Container: Run the Docker Registry container using the generated certificate files and configuration:
docker run -d \
  -p 443:443 \
  --name my-registry \
  -v /path/to/config.yml:/etc/docker/registry/config.yml \
  -v /path/to/domain.crt:/etc/docker/registry/domain.crt \
  -v /path/to/domain.key:/etc/docker/registry/domain.key \
  registry:2
Ensure you replace /path/to/ with the actual paths to your configuration file, SSL certificate, and SSL private key.
1. Configure Docker Client to Trust the Registry: If you're using self-signed certificates, copy the domain.crt file to the Docker host and add it to Docker's trusted certificates.
2. Test Registry Access: Once the registry is running, test access to it using the Docker client:	
docker login <IP_Address>

You'll be prompted to enter your Docker Registry username and password.
By following these steps, you'll have a Docker Registry set up with a self-signed TLS certificate using the IP address of the machine. This enables secure communication between Docker clients and the registry, ensuring the integrity and security of your container images
